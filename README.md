# Springer

Springer is a base for any sass project following a strict 7-1 pattern and BEM.

## Installation

Clone in to project and build 'main.scss' using your favourite method.

## FAQ

### Why are no vendor prefixes used?

In my workflow, I use autoprefixer at build time. 

## License

None - In short, do what you want, but if you think you can improve the project, put in a PR to help out everyone else. :)
